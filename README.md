# CS100-Projects
The Files of all the projects while taking CS100 (Software Construction) at University of California, Riverside in Spring 2020. The main purpose of the course was to become familiar and comfortable using design patterns and software development flow.  

## Working in a Team
 All of the projects were done with a small team. For all of the design pattern projects it was done with myself and a partner Raymond Booth. For the final project it was done in a group of three: myself, Jonathan Clarke and Emily Wu. The projects gave insight to working in a real development team because this course was taken over the ordeal of COVID-19. I never met my partners in real life during the course. 

## Design Patterns Used in Projects
 - Strategy Pattern
 - Composite Pattern
 - Decorator Pattern
 - Factory Pattern
 - Visitor Pattern 

## Testing 
All the unit tests for each project were done using the fairly standard Google Unit Test Framework (gtest) for C++.
